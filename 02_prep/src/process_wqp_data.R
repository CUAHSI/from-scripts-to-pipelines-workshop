#' @title Filter and clean the downloaded WQP data
#' @description This function takes the downloaded WQP data and filters to just 
#' one desired characteristic/fraction combination. Then, it applies some data
#' cleaning to bring together the result values and units, which are stored in 
#' different columns depending on whether the measurement represents a value
#' below the detection limit.
#' 
#' @param wqp_data_raw a data.frame with downloaded data from WQP, such as from
#' the pipeline function `download_wqp_physchem_data()`. 
#' @param characteristic a single character string representing one possible
#' value that appears in the column `CharacteristicName`. You can access the full
#' list of possible values at https://www.waterqualitydata.us/Codes/Characteristicname?mimeType=xml.
#' @param fraction a single character string representing one possible value that
#' appears in the column `ResultSampleFractionTest`, e.g. 'Total', 'Dissolved',
#' 'Suspended', etc.

#' @title Summarize the refined WQP data per site
#' @description Summarize the filtered and cleaned data to output site-based counts,
#' percentage of records that were non-detects, and mean values.
#' 
#' @param wqp_data_refined a data.frame of WQP data that has been filtered to 
#' represent *ONE* characteristic-fraction combo and must contain at least the
#' following columns: `MonitoringLocationIdentifier`, `CharacteristicName`, 
#' `result_unit`, `result_value`, and `non_detect`.

#' @title Isolate just the site metadata from the full dataset
#' @description WQP downloaded data via `dataRetrieval` comes with an data.frame
#' attribute called `siteInfo`, containing metadata for the sites present in the 
#' downloaded dataset. It includes things like site type, site full name, and 
#' location. Any filtering done to the data after it was downloaded, such as 
#' in `refine_wqp_data()`, will *not* filter the siteInfo attribute unless 
#' specifically added as custom code.
#' 
#' @param wqp_data_raw a data.frame with downloaded data from WQP, such as from
#' the pipeline function `download_wqp_physchem_data()`.
#' @param sites a vector of the sites to retain
#'
